      <h1>Privacy Policy for SafeClick Extension</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 14, 2025</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to SafeClick ("we," "our," "us"). We are committed to protecting
        your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and
        safeguard your information when you use our SafeClick Chrome Extension.
      </p>
      <p>
        This extension was developed as a semester project for the Information
        Security course at COMSATS University by Sarmad, Ikram Ullah Khan, Nazim
        Fareed, and Mazhar Latif.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        To provide our security analysis service, we need to collect the
        following information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Visited URLs:</strong> When you navigate to a new website, the
          full URL of that page is sent to our secure backend server for
          analysis.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>NOT</strong> collect any other personally identifiable
        information (PII) such as your IP address, email, name, or browsing
        history beyond the single URL being analyzed. The collection is limited
        strictly to the URL of the active tab you are currently visiting.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the collected URLs for the sole purpose of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Security Analysis:</strong> The URL is processed by our
          machine learning model to calculate a risk score and determine if the
          website is potentially a phishing site or otherwise malicious. This
          result is then sent back to your extension to alert you.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The collected URLs are not used for tracking, advertising, or any other
        purpose. We do not build a personal profile of your browsing habits.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        We do <strong>NOT</strong> sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your
        information with any third parties. The data you send is used
        exclusively for the security functionality of the SafeClick extension.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take data security seriously. All communication between the SafeClick
        extension and our backend server is encrypted using HTTPS. While no
        method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, we use
        commercially acceptable means to protect your data.
      </p>

      <h2>User Control</h2>
      <p>
        Our extension provides you with full control over its behavior through
        the whitelist and blacklist features. This data is stored locally in
        your browser and is not transmitted to our servers.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you
        of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are
        advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
      </p>

      <h2>Contact Us</h2>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.
